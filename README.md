## Detailed Explanation of the Memory Game React App

### Overview

This memory card game is a React application designed to test and enhance memory skills. The objective is to flip cards and find matching pairs with the fewest attempts. The application tracks the user's attempts and stores the best score in local storage to provide a competitive aspect.

### App Structure

The app consists of two main components:

1. **Card Component** (`Card.js`)
2. **App Component** (`App.js`)

### Components and Their Roles

#### Card Component (`Card.js`)

The `Card` component is a stateless functional component that displays each card in the game. It receives three props:

- **card**: An object containing the card's content and ID.
- **onClick**: A function to handle the card click event.
- **isFlipped**: A boolean indicating whether the card is flipped.

The `Card` component uses `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving performance. When the card is clicked, it calls the `onClick` function unless it is already flipped.

#### App Component (`App.js`)

The `App` component is the main component that manages the game state and logic. It contains several state variables and functions:

- **State Variables**:
  - `deck`: An array representing the deck of cards.
  - `flippedCards`: An array storing the currently flipped cards.
  - `matchedPairs`: A counter for the number of matched pairs.
  - `attempts`: A counter for the number of attempts made.
  - `name`: The player's name.
  - `highScore`: An object storing the best score and player's name, retrieved from local storage.

- **Functions**:
  - `generateDeck()`: A helper function to create and shuffle the deck of cards.
  - `handleCardClick(card)`: A callback function handles the card click event. It adds the clicked card to `flippedCards` if it's not already flipped.
  - `resetGame()`: A function to reset the game state, generate a new deck, and reset counters.

The component also includes two `useEffect` hooks:

1. To handle the game logic when two cards are flipped. It increments the attempt counter and checks if the two flipped cards match. If they do, it marks them as matched. The `flippedCards` array is reset after a short delay.
2. To update the high score in local storage if the player achieves a new best score.

### Styling

The styling is handled using CSS in two files:

#### Card Styles (`Card.css`)

The card styles define the appearance of the cards, including their size, font, background color, and hover effects. It also includes responsive styles for different screen sizes.

#### App Styles (`App.css`)

The app styles define the layout and appearance of the overall application, including the board layout, input fields, score display, and reset button.

### Game Logic

The game starts with a shuffled deck of cards. The player flips cards to find matching pairs. The game keeps track of the number of attempts and updates the high score if the player achieves a new best score.

- When two cards are flipped, the app checks if they match. If they do, they are marked as matched.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched, and a winning message is displayed.
- The player can reset the game anytime to start a new game with a shuffled deck.

### Running the App
